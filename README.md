# Summary of sqlalchemy-challenge

* Conducted a comprehensive climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Queried historical weather data focusing on precipitation and temperature observations.

* Connected to the SQLite database, reflected tables into Python classes, and established a query session.

* Extracted and plotted the last 12 months of precipitation data.

*Identified the most active weather station by observation count and analyzed its temperature trends, plotting the data as a histogram.

*Designed a Flask API to serve data through endpoints for precipitation, station data, temperature observations, and temperature statistics.

*The API generates dynamic JSON responses for interactive climate data exploration.

*Visual summaries include a line graph of 12 months' precipitation, a bar graph of observation counts per station, and a histogram of temperatures at the most active station.
Graphs are presented in "climate_starter.ipynb" and the Flask API code is in "app_solved.py", both stored in the "SurfsUp" folder.
